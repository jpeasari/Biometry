Problem 1. Define, compare and contrast fixed vs random factors. Provide specific examples of
each and why would you must take their differences into account when designing an experiment.
(No need to fallow format for this question.)

Problem 2. a. Determine if adding different sugars to the growth media in Drosophila has an
effect in the development of ocular units. 
b. Provide the mean treatment effect that each factor level has, ie, individual ái’s. What can you conclude from that information?

Problem 3. The Australian brown tree snake was introduced in Guam and has cause the
extinction of two native birds. This snake seems to reproduce more often and less seasonally than
in its native range in Australia. The data provided represents the grams of fat in the sexual
segment of the kidney, which is a good indication of sperm production in males. All of the data
was collected in the non-breeding. Determine if there are any differences among the populations.

Problem 4. Wood density, and to a great extent hardness, is mostly determine by the number of
pores per square mm in the wood. Determine which of the three species has the greatest
hardness. Which one the least?
