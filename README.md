# Biometry 1

1. Using the data set ‘limpets’ generate a bar graph with all the appropriate labels, correct
axis.
2. Bees use their wings to absorb sunlight and warm up in the mornings. In city
environments, like St. Louis, that have the heat island effect, darker wings may be
counterproductive. Using the data set ‘wing light translucent’ test the hypothesis that
bees in the north side of the city have lighter wings than those in the south side.
3. In the paper by Willig and Camilo (1991), what kind of t-test was performed. How did
they justified the test? Was this the most appropriate test?
