# Nested Anova Design

1. In the paper by Pringle et al., what was the main biological question that the authors
addressed? What was the experimental design they used, and why does it fit the question?
Finally, what was the statistical model they used for their analysis?

2. A geneticist collected data on the codon bias index (CBI), a measure of the nonrandom use of
synonymous codons from genes in Drosophila melanogaster. The groups are three chromosomes,
and the subgroups are small regions within each chromosome. Each observation is the CBI value
for a single gene in that chromosome region, and there were several genes per region. Are there
different cbiâ€™s among regions and chromosomes?
